SQL is a query editor language that allows users to use code to communicate with the data. In this assignment SQL was used to assist the company Pewlett Hackard to determine which employees meet a specific criteria. Queries of code were written to tell SQL the specific data that was needed. 
Pewlett Hackard needed help in determning which employees were eligable for retirement and a mentorship programs. We wrote code to tell SQL to narrow employyes based on year of birth and time worked in the company. 
                                                            Results
In the first deliverable we exported the Retirement titles we used the birthdate column to determine what employees met the age criteria. Next we exported the unique titles csv. THis was created by organizing the employees by distinct roles in the company deceding by employee number.  Next we had the mentorship program, and instead of looking retirees we were looking for employees who could metor younger ones.
